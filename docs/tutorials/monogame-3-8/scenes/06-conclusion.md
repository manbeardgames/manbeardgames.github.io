# Conclusion
In this tutorial, we discussed what the idea of a game **Scene** is and, defined a foundation for one, then created the code for it.  We then created two test scenes that we could use to demonstrate the idea.  

We also discussed an important topic of content management between scenes and how we can use separate `ContentManager` instances to store global assets and scene specific assets.

In the next tutorial series, we'll take the scene setup we just created a little further and show how to create cool transition effects when switching from one scene to the next.
