# Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have added the ability to change scenes in our game with transition effects.  We updated the code from the previous [Scenes](../scenes/introduction) tutorial to use `RenderTarget2D`'s and added in the `Transition` class that we can build upon to make neat transitions.  We updated the `Game1` class to handle switching the scenes with the transitions.
