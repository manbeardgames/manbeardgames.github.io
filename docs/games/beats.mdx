Beats is a one button music rhythm game made for the Game Dev's Quest One Mechanic Game Jam #5. Running through the forest, our adventurere is meet with skeletons blocking his path. Using the beat of the song, the adventurer must attack the skeletons as the approach, before they atack him.

The current version of the game is a prototype version made for the Jam, with only one song/stage. As the song begins, skeletons will appear and move toward the attack zone, where players must hit the button to attack them in beat with the music.
