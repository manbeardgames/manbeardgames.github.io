                                place and then build it for multiple platforms. This includes Windows (DirectX),
                                Windows, Mac, and Linux (OpenGL), Android devices, IOS devices, Playstation 4, Xbox One,
                                and Nintendo Switch to name a few. Developing for multiple platforms however can seem
                                like a daunting task to setup. How do you manage your code base? Do you have separate
                                projects for each platform? If so, would you have to copy/paste code between the
                                projects to ensure they are all in sync with each other?</p>
                            <p>Well, that&#39;s one way to do it, though I wouldn&#39;t suggest going that route.
                                Attempting to manage the same code base duplicated across multiple projects can be a
                                nightmare, lead to fragmented code, and becomes almost impossible to maintain.</p>
                            <p>Instead, a more thought out approach to developing for multiple platforms would be to
                                have one project where all of your game logic lives. Then this one project is referenced
                                by each individual project type for the platforms you want to support. These individual
                                projects at this point basically act as a launcher for the game for their respective
                                platforms. Once past the launching point, they are all utilizing the same exact single
                                project that your game logic was developed in.</p>
                            <p>Doing this approach isn&#39;t new to application or game development, though it may be
                                one you&#39;re unfamiliar with or didn&#39;t know you could do. Like anything else when
                                dealing with code development, there are multiple ways to achieving this goal.</p>
                            <p>In this tutorial, I&#39;m going to layout three separate methods for achieving this. In
                                the first method, we&#39;ll take a look at using a <strong>Class Library</strong>
                                project with the <strong>Monogame Framework PCL</strong>. In this approach, the the code
                                we develop will create a <strong>.dll</strong> that is then referenced by each of our
                                platform specific project types. Next, we&#39;ll look at setting up a <strong>C# Shared
                                    Project</strong> that is referenced by each of our platform project types. In this
                                method, instead of a .dll being built that is referenced by our projects, each project
                                compiles the shared projects code with itself. The last method we&#39;ll look will use
                                the <strong>MonoGame Shared Project</strong> template that is provided by MonoGame when
                                you install it. This one will work almost identically to the C# Shared Project method,
                                with the difference being how we manage content for our game between the projects.</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=prerequisites>Prerequisites</h2>
                            <p>If you want to follow along with this tutorial on your own computer, the following is a
                                list of things you&#39;ll need to ensure you have installed first. Doing so will ensure
                                that you have the necessary software to complete the tutorial. If however you&#39;d
                                rather just read the tutorial to understand the concepts, you can skip over this
                                prerequisite section.</p>

                                    there is no official MonoGame installer that supports it yet. <ul>

                                        During part of this tutorial, we will use the MonoGame Android Project template
                                        to create a new android game project. If you do not have the <b>Mobile
                                            Development with .NET</b> workload installed for Visual Studio, you will
                                        receive an error when attempting to create the project. To add this workload to
                                        Visual Studio, you'll need to modify your Visual Studio installation to include
                                        this workload.

                                        For Windows 10 users, you can do this by hitting the **windows** key on your
                                        keyboard (or clicking the windows/start button at the bottom left of your
                                        taskbar). The type <b>Programs and Features</b> and select the Programs and
                                        Features result. Next find <b>Visual Studio Community 2017</b> in the list of
                                        installed programs, then click the <b>Change</b> button at the top. When the
                                        Visual Studio Install window opens, locate the <b>Mobile Development with
                                            .NET</b> workload, check that you want to include it, then click the
                                        <b>Modify</b> button in the bottom right. After it finishes, you'll have that
                                        workload installed.

                            <h1 class="mt-5" id=method-1-the-class-library-approach>Method 1: The Class Library Approach</h1>
                            <p>In this section, we&#39;re going to setup our game development solution using a
                                <strong>Class Library</strong> as the central project for all of our game code. When a
                                class library project is compiled, it produces a dynamic link library, or
                                <strong>dll</strong>, file. This dll will contain all of the code necessary for our
                                game. Then, each of the platform specific projects will reference this dll file to
                                launch our game specific to how that platform needs to call it to launch. This is
                                aligned with the goal of this tutorial by providing one project to develop all game
                                logic in with individual platform specific projects to run the game code.</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=create-the-solution-1>Create The Solution</h2>
                            <p>A solution (.sln) file is a structured file used by Visual Studio to organize the
                                projects that we create within Visual Studio. Since we are going to be adding multiple
                                projects types to our overall project, we&#39;ll first need to create an empty solution.
                            </p>
                            <div class="card text-white bg-dark mb-3">

                                        Typically, when creating a new project in Visual Studio, a solution file is
                                        automatically create for you and placed in the same directory as the project. We
                                        could take advantage of this for the tutorial, however since we are going to be
                                        working with multiple projects, I think it would be a good idea to show creating
                                        one manually first.

                            <p>To start, we need to create a directory on our computer that we can store our solution
                                file and all of the associated projects in. For the purpose of this tutorial, create a
                                new folder on your desktop called <strong>class-library-example</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Next, launch Visual Studio if you don&#39;t already have it open. On the top menu click
                                <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project</strong>. This will open the <em>New Project</em>

                            <p>At the bottom of the <em>New Project</em> window, we need to give our solution a name.
                                Let&#39;s call it <strong>MyAwesomeGame</strong>. After entering the name, click the

                                <strong>class-library-example</strong> directory that we created previously. Also, for
                                the purpose of what we&#39;re doing, be sure the <strong>Create directory for
                                    solution</strong> is unchecked. When finished, click the <em>Ok</em> button.</p>

                                        The solution explorer window gives us a hierarchial view of our solution, the
                                        projects, and all files associated with them. If you do not have the <i>Solution

                                first right-click the solution in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select
                                <strong>Add &gt; New Project...</strong>. This opens the <em>New Project</em> window for
                                us again.</p>
                            <p>In the <em>New Project</em> window, click <strong>Visual C#</strong> on the left side of

                                <strong>Class Library (.NET Framework)</strong> item and select it. </p>
                            <p>

                            <div class="card text-white bg-dark mb-3">
                                <div class="card-header">
                                    <span class="lead">What are there multiple Class Library items listed</span>
                                </div>
                                <div class="card-body">
                                    <p>
                                        You may have noticed that in the list, there are <b>.NET Framework</b>, <b>.NET
                                            Standard</b>, and <b>Legacy Portable</b> Class Library items. Each of these
                                        is for the different .NET platform developing you are developing for. Since
                                        MonoGame uses .NET Framework, this is the on we'll be choosing.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>Next, just as we did with the solution, we need to give our class library project a name
                                at the bottom. Let&#39;s call it <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>. Appending the
                                name with <em>.Shared</em> serves two purposes. First, it allows us to visually identify
                                this project as the one that will be shared with the others. Second, Visual Studio will
                                automatically generate the <em>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</em> namespace for us when we create
                                new code files. This helps when referencing this code in the other platform specific
                                projects. </p>
                            <p>You may also need to click the <em>Browse</em> button and navigate to and select the
                                <strong>class-library-example</strong> directory that we created, if this is not already
                                the directory selected. Finally, for the purposes of this tutorial, click the
                                <em>Frameworks</em> dropdown and select the <strong>.NET 4.5</strong> option. When
                                finished, click the <em>Ok</em> button to create the project.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\give-class-library-a-name.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once you click Ok, Visual Studio will create the class library project for us. If you
                                look in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel, you can see the new project, and that it
                                already has one code file called <strong>Class1.cs</strong>. We don&#39;t need this
                                file, so go ahead and delete it.</p>
                            <p>Now we need to do one last thing for now to our class library project. We want to develop
                                all of our game code here, but this class library project has no idea what the MonoGame
                                Framework is and how to reference it. So we need to add the reference in. Thankfully, we
                                can do this through the use of a NuGet package provided by the MonoGame team. </p>
                            <p>To do this, right-click on the <em>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</em> project in the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> window and select <strong>Manage NuGet packages...</strong>. This will
                                open the <em>NuGet Package Manager</em> window for us in Visual Studio. Click the
                                <strong>Browse</strong> link at the top of the window, then, in the search bar below it
                                type <strong>MonoGame.Framework.Portable</strong>. Select the
                                <strong>MonoGame.Framework.Portable</strong> item in the list of results that is by the
                                <strong>MonoGame Team</strong>, then to the right of it, click the <em>Install</em>
                                button.</p>
                            <p>

                                        When choosing to install a NuGet package, there is a dropdown beside the install
                                        button where you can choose which version of the package to install. It's
                                        generally best to always select the one listed as the <i>Latest Stable</i>
                                        version, unless you have a specific reason to use a previous version. For the
                                        <b>MonoGame.Framework.Portable</b> package, as of the time of writing the
                                        tutorial, the latest stable version listed is 3.7.1.189
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>After clicking the Install button, you&#39;ll receive a pop up to preview what is being
                                installed. When finished reviewing it, click the <em>Ok</em> button. Once you click OK,
                                the MonoGame.Framework.Portable package will be downloaded and installed into your
                                project. If you expand the <em>References</em> for the project in the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> panel, you&#39;ll see that you now have
                                <strong>MonoGame.Framework</strong> added, along with a few others that are needed by
                                the framework. You can close the <em>NugGt Package Manager</em> window.</p>
                            <p>And that&#39;s it for now for the class library project. Now lets start adding in the
                                platform specific projects that are going to be referencing it.</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=add-a-monogame-cross-platform-desktop-project-1>Add A MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop

                            <p>The first platform specific project type we&#39;re going to add is the <strong>MonoGame
                                    Cross Platform Desktop Project</strong>. Now, I know what your thinking,
                                &quot;Couldn&#39;t I just have used this one project type, since it&#39;s name contains
                                <strong>Cross Platform</strong>?&quot;. Well, no. See, this project does support
                                different operating systems, namely Windows, Mac, and Linux, using OpenGL as its
                                graphics library. However those are operating systems, and the platform, for purposes of
                                definition for this tutorial, would be Desktop.</p>
                            <p>To add this project, right-click the solution in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel and
                                select <strong>Add &gt; New Project...</strong>, opening the <em>New Project</em>
                                window. Select <strong>MonoGame</strong> on the left under <em>Visual C#</em>, then
                                select the <strong>MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop Project</strong> item.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">

                            <p>Now we need to give this project a name at the bottom. Let&#39;s call it
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong>. We&#39;ll use <em>.OpenGL</em> appended to the
                                name because while this project supports Windows, Mac, and Linux, the one thing they all
                                have in common within this project is that OpenGL is used for the graphics library. Be
                                sure to click the <em>Browse</em> button and navigate to and select the
                                <strong>class-library-example</strong> directory we created. When finished, click the
                                <em>Ok</em> button.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">

                            </p>
                            <p>Once you click the Ok button, Visual Studio will generate the project for you based on
                                the MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop Project template. You can see the project and all of
                                the generated files in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel. Find the
                                <strong>Program.cs</strong> file that was generated and open it. </p>
                            <p>The <strong>Program.cs</strong> file contains the <code>static void Main</code> method,
                                which is the starting point when your game is run. On line 16 and 17, you see the
                                following code</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">            <span class="token keyword">using</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">var</span> game <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Game1</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

                            <p>The <code>using</code> statement creates a new instance of the <code>Game1</code> class,
                                then calls the <code>Run</code> method. This is how this specific platform project
                                launches your game. We need to adjust this so instead it is calling the
                                <code>Game1</code> class from the Shared project, this way it&#39;s using the one
                                central shared code base.</p>
                            <p>To do this, first locate the <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file in the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> panel and right-click it, then select <strong>Copy</strong>. Then
                                right-click the <em>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</em> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em>
                                panel and select <strong>Paste</strong>. This creates a copy of Game1.cs for us in our
                                Shared project. Since we have it in our shared project, we don&#39;t need it anymore in
                                the <em>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</em> project. Find the <strong>Game1.cs</strong> in the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGl</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window,
                                right-click it and select <strong>Delete</strong> to delete it.</p>
                            <p>Now we need to make some small adjustments. Open the <em>Game1.cs</em> file in the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong> project. On line 5, you see the
                                <code>namespace</code> declaration, which shows</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">namespace</span> MyAwesomeGame<span class="token punctuation">.</span>OpenGL</code></pre>
                            <p>Change this to</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">namespace</span> MyAwesomeGame<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Shared</code></pre>
                            <p>It had the <em>.OpenGL</em> namespace because we simply just copied the file over.
                                Changing it will ensure it has the correct namespace within our Shared project.</p>
                            <p>Next, if you don&#39;t still have it open, locate <strong>Program.cs</strong> under
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel
                                and open it. You should see immediately that it now has an error on line 16 when it
                                calls <code>new Game1()</code>. This is because we deleted the Game1 for this project,
                                so right now it has no idea what Game1 is, or for that matter, where to locate it. So we
                                need to show it where to locate it. To do this, we need to add a reference to the Shared
                                project. </p>
                            <p>Find <strong>References</strong> under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel, right-click it and select <strong>Add
                                    Reference...</strong>. This will open the <em>Reference Manager</em> window. Click
                                <strong>Projects</strong> in the list on the left, then check the box for
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong> in the middle. Finally, click the <em>Ok</em>
                                button when finished.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\add-class-library-reference.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once you click the Ok button, you should now see <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>
                                listed under the references for the project.</p>
                            <p>Next, in the <strong>Program.cs</strong> file, on line 2, add the following</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> MyAwesomeGame<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Shared<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
                            <p>Now, the call to <code>new Game1()</code> on line 16 will no longer have an error.
                                We&#39;ve add the reference to our Shared project and the using statement at the top, so
                                it now knows what and where the Game1 class is. Save and close the Program.cs file.</p>
                            <p>Now, lets make sure this is working the way we intend it to. Open the
                                <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under our Shared project. Find the constructor, which
                                should start on line 15. We&#39;re going to edit it to make the game launch in a window
                                instead of full screen. Change it to look like the following</p>
                            <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token function">Game1</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    graphics <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">GraphicsDeviceManager</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">this</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    Content<span class="token punctuation">.</span>RootDirectory <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"Content"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token comment">//  Do not launch in full screen</span>
    graphics<span class="token punctuation">.</span>IsFullScreen <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">false</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
                            <p>Now, if we click the <strong>Start</strong> button at the top, our game should launch in
                                a window with a nice cornflower blue background. It should, but it won&#39;t. This is
                                because currently our Shared project is set as the &quot;StartUp project&quot;. This
                                means when we click Start at the top, it starts whatever our StartUp project is. Class
                                Library projects cannot be started directly. To fix this, first close the error message.
                                Then right-click <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> in the <em>Solution Explorer</em>
                                panel and select <strong>Set as StartUp Project</strong>. Now, when you click the Start
                                button at the top, as expected, the game launches to the perfect little cornflower blue
                                window.</p>
                            <p>We have successfully now added a new platform project and connected it to our central
                                shared project that contains our game logic. So what&#39;s next? Well...lets add another
                                platform specific project shall we?</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=add-a-monogame-android-project-1>Add A MonoGame Android Project</h2>
                            <p>We want our game to be truly multiplatform. And what is more multiplatform than also
                                supporting mobile devices like Android. So lets add a MonoGame Android Project. </p>
                            <p>First, right-click the solution in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select
                                <strong>Add &gt; New Project...</strong> to open the <em>New Project</em> window. Click
                                <strong>MonoGame</strong> on the left under <em>Visual C#</em>, then select the
                                <strong>MonoGame Android Project</strong> item.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\select-monogame-android.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Then, just like before, we need to give the project a name at the bottom. Let&#39;s call
                                this one <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong>, since it&#39;s for Android. Be sure to
                                click the <em>Browse</em> button and choose the <strong>class-library-example</strong>
                                directory that we created earlier. When finished, click the <em>Ok</em> button</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\give-android-name.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Now, when creating a new MonoGame Android project, there are a couple of things we have
                                to configure. The first is that we need to add an AndroidManifest file. What this file
                                is is beyond the scope of this tutorial, however we still have to add it. To do this,
                                right-click the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> window and select <strong>Properties</strong> to open the
                                <em>Properties</em> window. Locate <strong>Android Manifest</strong> on the left, then
                                click the <strong>No AndroidManifest.xml found. Click to add one.</strong> link to
                                generate it. </p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\add-androd-manifest.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once it finishes, you will receive a <em>File Modification Detected</em> notification pop
                                up. This is normal, just click the <strong>Reload All</strong> button. Once this is
                                finished, click the save button at the top of Visual Studio, then close the properties
                                window.</p>
                            <p>Next, we need to open the <strong>Activity1.cs</strong> file located under
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window.
                                Immediately, you should see that there is an error on line 13. This is is because the
                                code added when the project is generated is out of date, so lets fix it really quick.
                                Change line 13 to the following (note that you need to include the , at the beginning)
                            </p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token punctuation">,</span> LaunchMode <span class="token operator">=</span> LaunchMode<span class="token punctuation">.</span>SingleInstance</code></pre>
                            <p>That takes care of the quick things we need to do, now let&#39;s hook up our Android
                                project so that it&#39;s using the Shared project just like our OpenGl project. First,
                                locate <strong>Game1.cs</strong> under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and open it. While this is largely identical to the
                                Game1 class file that was generated by our OpenGl project, there is a small difference.
                                Notice that starting on line 20 in the constructor, there are various properties being
                                set for the graphics object. </p>
                            <p>These are important things to set for our android project so we need to ensure we are
                                still setting them in our shared project. So close the Game1.cs file, and then locate
                                the <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>
                                project. In here you&#39;ll notice that on line 19 in the constructor we already are
                                setting the IsFullScreen property, but we are setting it to <code>false</code>. For
                                Android, we need to set it to <code>true</code>. So how do we resolve this.</p>
                            <p>In the Class Library approach we are using, we need to have a way of defining which
                                platform is calling the Game1 class. The simplest solution to this is to use an enum.
                                Find the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em>
                                panel, right-click it and select <strong>Add &gt; New Item</strong> to open the <em>New
                                    Item</em> window. Click <strong>Visual C#</strong> in the list on the left, then
                                scroll down and locate the <strong>Code File</strong> item and select it. Next, give it
                                a name at the bottom, lets call it <strong>Platforms</strong>. When finished click the
                                <em>Ok</em> button to create the file.</p>

                            <p>Next, find the constructor method for Game1 starting on line 16 and change it so it now
                                accepts a <code>Platforms</code> enum as a parameter and then sets the

                                need to separate the graphics properties that are set depending on which platform is
                                called. The method should now look like this</p>

                            <p>What we are doing here is requiring that when creating a new Game1 instance, a Platform
                                enum value must be passed to it. We save this value in a static field called Platform,
                                which we can then reference throughout our project anytime we need to separate our logic
                                based on specific platforms. We then do this when setting the graphics properties.</p>
                            <div class="card text-white bg-dark mb-3">
                                <div class="card-header">
                                    <span class="lead">What About Preprocessor Directives</span>

                                        In this approach, we are using an enum value to differentiate between our
                                        platforms. Later in this tutorial when we discuss the other two approaches,
                                        we'll instead use something called a preprocessor directive. These cannot be
                                        used here however because the class library is complied down to a dll separate
                                        from the actual platform specific projects.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>When finished, be sure to save the file and close it.</p>
                            <p>So now that we have our shared Game1 class file setup for both projects, located the
                                <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> and delete
                                it, just like we did before. Next, if it is not already open, open the
                                <strong>Activity1.cs</strong> file under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong>
                                project. You&#39;ll notice that just like with the OpenGL project, we now have an error,
                                on line 21, because it doesn&#39;t know what or where Game1 is. So lets fix this.</p>
                            <p>Locate <strong>References</strong> under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel, right-click it select <strong>Add
                                    Reference...</strong> to open the <em>Reference Manager</em> window. Then just like
                                before, click <strong>Projects</strong> on the left and check the box for
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>. Finally click Ok to close the <em>Reference
                                    Manager</em> window and add the reference. </p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\add-class-library-reference-for-android.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Next, in the Activity1.cs file, at the top, add the following using statement just as we
                                did before. </p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> MyAwesomeGame<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Shared<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
                            <p>After adding this using statement, the error on line 22 doesn&#39;t go away like it did
                                before. This is because we changed the method signature for Game1 so it requires we give
                                it a Platform value now. We need to tell it that we are using an Android platform. Edit
                                line 22 so that it passes the <strong>Platform.Android</strong> value to Game1 when
                                it&#39;s created like the following.</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">var</span> g <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Game1</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>Platforms<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Android<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
                            <p>Now the error should now go away. Save and close the file. You&#39;ve probably guess what
                                we have to do next. If you guess that we need to edit <strong>Program.cs</strong> in the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project so it passes the
                                <code>Platforms.OpenGL</code> value, then you&#39;d be correct. Go ahead and open
                                <strong>Program.cs</strong> and edit the using statement on line 17 to the following</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">var</span> game <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Game1</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>Platforms<span class="token punctuation">.</span>OpenGL<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
                            <p>And that&#39;s it, we&#39;ve now successfully add a new platform specific project
                                (Android), and connected it to use the same shared code logic that is used by our other
                                project. And we can separate logic based on platforms if we need to</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=creating-a-single-content-project-1>Creating A Single Content Project</h2>
                            <p>With the way things are setup right now, all of our game logic will be created in our
                                shared project. This is then shared out to the our individual OpenGL and Android
                                projects to use. However, both of those projects contain their own <em>Content.mgcb</em>
                                file. This means when we want to add a new content file to our game, we have to add it
                                twice, one to each project. This is no good and runs against the whole goal of what
                                we&#39;re achieving. So lets fix this.</p>
                            <p>First, lets add one more project to our solution. Right-click the solution in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select <strong>Add &gt; New Project...</strong> to
                                open the <em>New Project</em> window. Next, click <strong>MonoGame</strong> under
                                <strong>Visual C#</strong> on the left, then select the <strong>MonoGame Windows
                                    Project</strong> item.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\select-monogame-windows.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Next, give it a name at the bottom. Let&#39;s call this one
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Content</strong>, appending the <em>.Content</em> since this is
                                where we&#39;ll be adding all of our game content. As always, be sure to click the
                                <em>Browse</em> button and select the <strong>class-library-example</strong> directory
                                we created at the beginning of the tutorial, the click the <em>Ok</em> button.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\give-content-project-name.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once you click the Ok button, Visual Studio will generate the project for us. When
                                it&#39;s done, locate the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Content</strong> project in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel and expand it if it is not already so we can see all of
                                the files associated with it. Next, delete all of the files under that project EXCEPT
                                for the <strong>Content</strong> directory and the <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file
                                located inside it. We don&#39;t need any of the other files except this.</p>
                            <p>Now we need a way of telling the OpenGl and the Android projects to use the
                                <em>Content.mgcb</em> file under our Content project instead of their own. To do this,
                                first locate the <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file in the <strong>Content</strong>
                                directory for the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> window. Then right-click it and select <strong>Delete</strong>. Then
                                do the same in the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project.</p>
                            <p>Next, right-click the <strong>Content</strong> directory under the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel
                                and select <strong>Add &gt; Existing Item...</strong>. Navigate to the
                                <strong>class-library-example</strong> directory we created. Then open the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Content</strong> directory, and then open the
                                <strong>Content</strong> directory inside of it. Single click (not double) the
                                <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file located in this directory. Next, notice that the
                                <strong>Add</strong> button in the bottom right of the <em>Add Existing Item</em> window
                                has a little arrow on it&#39;s right side. Click this, and select the <strong>Add As

                                        When you open the MyAwesomeGame.Content/Content directory and go to select the
                                        <b>Content.mgbc</b> file above, you may actually instead see an empty directory
                                        with no files. If this happens, click the dropdown located at the bottom right
                                        of the window and change it from <i>Visual C#</i> to <b>All Files</b>. Then you
                                        should see it.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>By clicking the <em>Add As Link</em> option, we&#39;re not actually adding the
                                <em>Content.mgcb</em> file to our Android project. Instead, anytime the Android project
                                references the Content.mgcb file, for instance when it compiles, it will instead now use
                                the Content.mgcb file located in our Content project. So now, do the same steps we just did
                                to add the <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file to the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project, but remember to use the <strong>Add As
                                    Link</strong> option.</p>
                            <p>There is one last thing we need to do. When we added the <strong>Content.mgcb</strong>
                                files back to the projects as <em>Existing Items</em>, they no longer contain the correct
                                <strong>Build Action</strong> property, so we need to set that. First, select the
                                <strong>Content.mgbc</strong> file under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong>
                                project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel. Then in the <em>Properties</em> panel,
                                for the <strong>Build Action</strong>, change it to
                                <strong>MonoGameContentReference</strong>.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">

                                        closed it by accident. If so, you can reopen it by clicking <b>View > Property

                            </div>

                            <p>Once you have changed the <em>Build Action</em>, do the same steps for the
                                <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file in the OpenGL project.</p>
                            <p>Now lets test that they are all using the same Content project. First, located the
                                <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Content</strong>
                                project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel and open it to launch the <em>MonoGame
                                    Pipeline Tool</em> window. Add a new <em>SpriteFont Description</em> item and name
                                it <strong>font</strong>.spritefont.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">

                            </p>
                            <p>Once you&#39;ve finished adding it, save and close the window. Now, open the
                                <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file for either the Android project or the OpenGL project,
                                you should see that both of them have the <strong>font.spritefont</strong> item listed.
                                Now all projects are using the same single shared content file.</p>

                            <p>Now, according the the code above, when we run our game on an android device, it should
                                display the <em>Hello World! This is the Android Project</em>, and when we run this on a
                                Desktop as the OpenGL project it should display <em>Hello World! This is the OpenGL
                                    project</em>. So lets test this.</p>
                            <p>First, make sure <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> is set as the StartUp Project. To
                                do this, right-click it in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select <strong>Set
                                    as StartUp Project</strong>. Then click the <strong>Start</strong> button at the top
                                of Visual Studio. The game will launch and you should see the following message
                                displayed</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\opengl-game-launch.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Pretty cool huh? If you have an android device, we can also test the Android project
                                directly on the device. If you do not have an android device, feel free to skip to the
                                next section. </p>
                            <p>To test on your android device, first you need to make sure you have <strong>Deveioper
                                    Options</strong> unlocked and <strong>USB Debugging</strong> enabled. To do this, on
                                your device go to <strong>Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Information</strong>.
                                Scroll down to where it lists the <strong>Build Number</strong> and tape the
                                <strong>Build Number</strong> seven times. Once finished, you&#39;ll receive a message
                                about the <strong>Developer Options</strong> now being available. Next go to
                                <strong>Settings &gt; Developer Options</strong> and scroll down to <strong>USB
                                    Debugging</strong> and toggle it on. This allows us to perform application debugging
                                using our Android device when it&#39;s connected to a computer via USB. </p>
                            <p>Next, make sure the device screen is on and unlocked if you have to enter a password or
                                pin to open it. Then connect the device to your computer via a USB cable. Once you do,
                                you&#39;ll receive a message popup on the device asking for permission for USB debugging
                                for your computer. Click to accept this.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in Visual Studio, locate the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in
                                the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window, right-click it and select <strong>Set as StartUp
                                    Project</strong>. Once you do, the <strong>Start</strong> button at the top of
                                Visual Studio will change to the name of your Android device. If you click the Start
                                button now, Visual Studio will build the android apk, push it to your android device and
                                automatically launch it. When it does, you should see the game with the Android message
                                this time.</p>
                            <p>

                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=conclusion-1>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>In this approach, we created a C# class library that uses the MonoGame.Framework.Portable
                                package. This class library is where we will develop all of our game code for our game.
                                When we need to differentiate between platforms for any specific reason in our code, we
                                can use the static property we created in the Game1 class. We have a separate single
                                project used to manage all of the content we need to add to our game, and just like our
                                class library, all other projects reference this.</p>
                            <p>This approach works, but it&#39;s not the the most efficient one. For one reason, when
                                our class library is compiled to a dll, it contains the logic for the different
                                platforms, even though they are separated by the if statements. However, we want to be
                                efficient and make our game build as small as possible. We don&#39;t want the build for
                                our Android game, on a mobile device with limited storage, to contain the code for our
                                Desktop game if it doesn&#39;t need it. And we also have to ensure that when we
                                distribute our game, the <strong>.dll</strong> that the class library project creates is
                                distributed with it. What a hassle.</p>
                            <p>In the next approach, we&#39;ll look at using a C# Shared Project. Using this will give
                                the same ultimate goal of keeping our game logic in once project that our platform
                                specific projects reference. However, the difference here will be that with the use of
                                a preprocessor directive, any time code is written specifically for one project type,
                                only that code will be complied instead of all of it. Plus, we won&#39;t have to include
                                dll files in our final distribution.</p>
                            <h1 class="mt-5" id=method-2-the-shared-project-approach>Method 2: The Shared Project Approach</h1>
                            <p>In this section, we&#39;re going to setup our game development solution using a standard
                                <strong>C# Shared Project</strong> as the central project for all of our game code.
                                Similar to the Class Library approach we just went over, each of our platform specific
                                project will act as the launching point for the game code and reference the shared
                                project for the actual game logic. The big difference here is that the shared project
                                doesn&#39;t compile by itself. Instead, when each of our platform specific projects
                                compile, they incorporate the code from the shared project into themselves. We can then
                                further use preprocessor directives to control specific blocks of code that should only
                                be included with specific platforms. Hopefully that wasn&#39;t to confusing. If so,
                                it&#39;ll make more sense when we finish, so lets get started.</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=create-the-solution-2>Create The Solution</h2>
                            <p>Just like with the previous approach, we are going to start with by creating a blank
                                solution. First, we need to create a new directory on our computer to store the new
                                solution file. For the purposes of this tutorial, create a new folder on your desktop
                                called <strong>shared-project-example</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Next, launch Visual Studio if you don&#39;t already have it open. On the top menu click
                                <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project</strong>. This will open the <em>New Project</em>
                                window. At the top right of this window is a search box. Click this and enter
                                <strong>Blank Solution</strong> for your search. Select the <strong>Blank
                                    Solution</strong> item (it should be the only one listed.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">

                            <p>At the bottom of the <em>New Project</em> window, we need to give our solution a name.
                                Let&#39;s call it <strong>MyAwesomeGame</strong>. After entering the name, click the
                                <em>Browse</em> button and navigate to and select the
                                <strong>shared-project-example</strong> directory that we created previously. Also, for
                                the purpose of what we&#39;re doing, be sure the <strong>Create directory for
                                    solution</strong> is unchecked. When finished, click the <em>Ok</em> button.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">

                            <p>Once you click the Ok button, Visual Studio will create the new solution file and open it
                                up. If you look in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel in Visual Studio, you should see
                                <em>Solution: &#39;MyAwesomeGame&#39; (0 Projects)</em> listed.</p>

                            <p>Now that we have our solution created, lets go ahead and create the <strong>Shared
                                    Project</strong> that will be used as the central code base. To do this, first
                                right-click the solution in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select <strong>Add
                                    &gt; New Project...</strong>. This opens the <em>New Project</em> window for us
                                again.</p>
                            <p>In the <em>New Project</em> window, click <strong>Visual C#</strong> on the left side of
                                the window to display all of the Visual C# project types. Next, locate the
                                <strong>Shared Project</strong> item and select it.</p>
                            <p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Next, at the bottom of the window, we need to give our shared project a name. Let&#39;s
                                call it <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>. Remember, we append the name
                                <em>.Shared</em> to we can visually identify this as the shared project, and also so the
                                namespaces are generated correctly for us by Visual Studio when we create new code
                                files. </p>
                            <p>You may also need to click the <em>Browse</em> button and navigate to and select the
                                <strong>shared-project-example</strong> directory that we created, if this is not
                                already the directory selected. Finally, for the purposes of this tutorial, click the
                                <em>Frameworks</em> dropdown and select the <strong>.NET 4.5</strong> option. When
                                finished, click the <em>Ok</em> button to create the project.</p>

                                the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel, you can see the new shared project, with no files.
                                That&#39;s it for the shared project for now. Let&#39;s go ahead and start adding our
                                platform specific projects.</p>

                            <p>The first platform specific project type we&#39;re going to add is the <strong>MonoGame
                                    Cross Platform Desktop Project</strong>. To Add this project, right-click the
                                solution in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel and select <strong>Add &gt; New

                                <strong>MonoGame</strong> on the left under <em>Visual C#</em>, then select the
                                <strong>MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop Project</strong> item.</p>
                            <p>

                            <p>Now we need to give this project a name at the bottom. Let&#39;s call it
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong>. We&#39;ll use <em>.OpenGL</em> appended to the
                                name because while this project supports Windows, Mac, and Linux, the one thing they all
                                have in common within this project is that OpenGL is used for the graphics library. Be
                                sure to click the <em>Browse</em> button and navigate to and select the
                                <strong>shared-project-example</strong> directory we created. When finished, click the
                                <em>Ok</em> button.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">

                            </p>
                            <p>Once you click the Ok button, Visual Studio will generate the project for you based on
                                the MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop Project template. You can see the project and all of
                                the generated files in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel. Find the
                                <strong>Program.cs</strong> file that was generated and open it. </p>
                            <p>The <strong>Program.cs</strong> file contains the <code>static void Main</code> method,
                                which is the starting point when your game is run. On line 16 and 17, you see the
                                following code</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">            <span class="token keyword">using</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">var</span> game <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Game1</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

                            <p>The <code>using</code> statement creates a new instance of the <code>Game1</code> class,
                                then calls the <code>Run</code> method. This is how this specific platform project
                                launches your game. We need to adjust this so instead it is calling the
                                <code>Game1</code> class from the Shared project, this way it&#39;s using the one
                                central shared code base.</p>
                            <p>To do this, first locate the <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file in the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> panel and right-click it, then select <strong>Copy</strong>. Then
                                right-click the <em>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</em> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em>
                                panel and select <strong>Paste</strong>. This creates a copy of Game1.cs for us in our
                                Shared project. Since we have it in our shared project, we don&#39;t need it anymore in
                                the <em>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</em> project. Find the <strong>Game1.cs</strong> in the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGl</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window,
                                right-click it and select <strong>Delete</strong> to delete it.</p>
                            <p>Now we need to make some small adjustments. Open the <em>Game1.cs</em> file in the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong> project. On line 5, you see the
                                <code>namespace</code> declaration, which shows</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">namespace</span> MyAwesomeGame<span class="token punctuation">.</span>OpenGL</code></pre>
                            <p>Change this to</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">namespace</span> MyAwesomeGame<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Shared</code></pre>
                            <p>It had the <em>.OpenGL</em> namespace because we simply just copied the file over.
                                Changing it will ensure it has the correct namespace within our Shared project.</p>
                            <p>Next, if you don&#39;t still have it open, locate <strong>Program.cs</strong> under
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel
                                and open it. You should see immediately that it now has an error on line 16 when it
                                calls <code>new Game1()</code>. This is because we deleted the Game1 for this project,
                                so right now it has no idea what Game1 is, or for that matter, where to locate it. So we
                                need to show it where to locate it. To do this, we need to add a reference to the Shared
                                project. </p>
                            <p>Find <strong>References</strong> under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel, right-click it and select <strong>Add
                                    Reference...</strong>. This will open the <em>Reference Manager</em> window. Click
                                <strong>Shared Project</strong> in the list on the left, then check the box for
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong> in the middle. Finally, click the <em>Ok</em>
                                button when finished.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"

                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once you click the Ok button, you should now see <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>
                                listed under the references for the project.</p>
                            <p>Next, in the <strong>Program.cs</strong> file, on line 2, add the following</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> MyAwesomeGame<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Shared<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
                            <p>Now, the call to <code>new Game1()</code> on line 16 will no longer have an error.
                                We&#39;ve add the reference to our Shared project and the using statement at the top, so
                                it now knows what and where the Game1 class is. Save and close the Program.cs file.</p>
                            <p>Now, lets make sure this is working the way we intend it to. Open the
                                <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under our Shared project. Find the constructor, which
                                should start on line 15. We&#39;re going to edit it to make the game launch in a window
                                instead of full screen. Change it to look like the following</p>
                            <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token function">Game1</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
                            <p>Now, if we click the <strong>Start</strong> button at the top, our game should launch in
                                a window with a nice cornflower blue background. We have successfully now added a new
                                platform project and connected it to our central shared project that contains our game
                                logic. </p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=add-a-monogame-android-project-2>Add A MonoGame Android Project</h2>
                            <p>We want our game to be truly multiplatform. And what is more multiplatform than also
                                supporting mobile devices like Android. So lets add a MonoGame Android Project. </p>
                            <p>First, right-click the solution in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select
                                <strong>Add &gt; New Project...</strong> to open the <em>New Project</em> window. Click
                                <strong>MonoGame</strong> on the left under <em>Visual C#</em>, then select the
                                <strong>MonoGame Android Project</strong> item.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\select-monogame-android.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Then, just like before, we need to give the project a name at the bottom. Let&#39;s call
                                this one <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong>, since it&#39;s for Android. Be sure to
                                click the <em>Browse</em> button and choose the <strong>shared-project-example</strong>
                                directory that we created earlier. When finished, click the <em>Ok</em> button</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\give-android-name.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Now, when creating a new MonoGame Android project, there are a couple of things we have
                                to configure. The first is that we need to add an AndroidManifest file. What this file
                                is is beyond the scope of this tutorial, however we still have to add it. To do this,
                                right-click the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> window and select <strong>Properties</strong> to open the
                                <em>Properties</em> window. Locate <strong>Android Manifest</strong> on the left, then
                                click the <strong>No AndroidManifest.xml found. Click to add one.</strong> link to
                                generate it. </p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\add-androd-manifest.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once it finishes, you will receive a <em>File Modification Detected</em> notification pop
                                up. This is normal, just click the <strong>Reload All</strong> button. Once this is
                                finished, click the save button at the top of Visual Studio, then close the properties
                                window.</p>
                            <p>Next, we need to open the <strong>Activity1.cs</strong> file located under
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window.
                                Immediately, you should see that there is an error on line 13. This is is because the
                                code added when the project is generated is out of date, so lets fix it really quick.
                                Change line 13 to the following (note that you need to include the , at the beginning)
                            </p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token punctuation">,</span> LaunchMode <span class="token operator">=</span> LaunchMode<span class="token punctuation">.</span>SingleInstance</code></pre>
                            <p>That takes care of the quick things we need to do, now let&#39;s hook up our Android
                                project so that it&#39;s using the Shared project just like our OpenGl project. First,
                                locate <strong>Game1.cs</strong> under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and open it. While this is largely identical to the
                                Game1 class file that was generated by our OpenGl project, there is a small difference.
                                Notice that starting on line 20 in the constructor, there are various properties being
                                set for the graphics object.</p>
                            <p>These are important things to set for our android project so we need to ensure we are
                                still setting them in our shared project. So close the Game1.cs file, and then locate
                                the <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>
                                project. In here you&#39;ll notice that on line 19 in the constructor we already are
                                setting the IsFullScreen property, but we are setting it to <code>false</code>. For
                                Android, we need to set it to <code>true</code>. So how do we resolve this.</p>
                            <p>Well, this is where the <code>#if</code> preprocessor directive comes into play. If
                                you&#39;re not familiar with what that is, you can read up on it at <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if</a>.
                                Basically, it allows us to use a <em>Symbol</em> to define blocks of code that will
                                only be compiled if the symbol exists. These Symbols are passed to the compiler by our
                                individual platform projects when they are built. If you right-click on the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window,
                                select <strong>Properties</strong>, then click <strong>Build</strong> on the left of the
                                <em>Property Window</em>, you can see that this project is has a <strong>Conditional
                                    compilation symbol</strong> value of <strong>ANDROID</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\android-symbol.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>If you do the same for the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project, you&#39;ll see
                                that it has a <strong>Conditional compilation symbol</strong> value of
                                <strong>LINUX</strong>. Yep, its value is Linux, that&#39;s what the MonoGame team
                                decided to use. </p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\linux-symbol.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>In the Class Library approach previously, we had to setup an enum that would be passed to
                                the Game1 constructor, its value cached, and then referenced throughout our project.
                                Using the preprocessor directives, we don&#39;t need to do this anymore. So, in the
                                <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file for the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong> project,
                                change the constructor to the following</p>
                            <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">        <span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token function">Game1</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

        <span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
                            <p>When finished, be sure to save the file. Making use of the <code>#if</code> statement
                                will become vital when developing your game as multiplatform. There will be times, like
                                above, where you need to set some values or do things differently for one platform
                                versus another.</p>
                            <p>Now that we have our shared Game1 class file setup for both projects, located the
                                <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> and delete
                                it, just like we did before. Next, if it is not already open, open the
                                <strong>Activity1.cs</strong> file under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong>
                                project. You&#39;ll notice that just like with the OpenGL project, we now have an error,
                                on line 21, because it doesn&#39;t know what or where Game1 is. So lets fix this.</p>
                            <p>Locate <strong>References</strong> under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel, right-click it select <strong>Add
                                    Reference...</strong> to open the <em>Reference Manager</em> window. Then just like
                                before, click <strong>Shared Projects</strong> on the left and check the box for
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>. Finally click Ok to close the <em>Reference
                                    Manager</em> window and add the reference.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\add-shared-project-reference-opengl.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Next, in the Activity1.cs file, at the top, add the following using statement just as we
                                did before. </p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> MyAwesomeGame<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Shared<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
                            <p>And just like with our OpenGL project, after adding the using statement above, the error
                                on line 22 goes away. Since it has the reference it now know what and where Game1 is.
                            </p>
                            <p>And that&#39;s it, we&#39;ve now successfully add a new platform specific project
                                (Android), and connected it to use the same shared code logic that is used by our other
                                project. And we can separate logic using the preprocessor directives if needed.</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=creating-a-single-content-project-2>Creating A Single Content Project</h2>
                            <p>With the way things are setup right now, all of our game logic will be created in our
                                shared project. This is then shared out to the our individual OpenGL and Android
                                projects to use. However, both of those projects contain their own <em>Content.mgcb</em>
                                file. This means when we want to add a new content file to our game, we have to add it
                                twice, one to each project. This is no good and runs against the whole goal of what
                                we&#39;re achieving. So lets fix this.</p>
                            <p>First, lets add one more project to our solution. Right-click the solution in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select <strong>Add &gt; New Project...</strong> to
                                open the <em>New Project</em> window. Next, click <strong>MonoGame</strong> under
                                <strong>Visual C#</strong> on the left, then select the <strong>MonoGame Windows
                                    Project</strong> item.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\select-monogame-windows.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Next, give it a name at the bottom. Let&#39;s call this one
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Content</strong>, appending the <em>.Content</em> since this is
                                where we&#39;ll be adding all of our game content. As always, be sure to click the
                                <em>Browse</em> button and select the <strong>shared-project-example</strong> directory
                                we created at the beginning of the tutorial, the click the <em>Ok</em> button.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\give-content-project-name.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once you click the Ok button, Visual Studio will generate the project for us. When
                                it&#39;s done, locate the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Content</strong> project in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel and expand it if it is not already so we can see all of
                                the files associated with it. Next, delete all of the files under that project EXCEPT
                                for the <strong>Content</strong> directory and the <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file
                                located inside it. We don&#39;t need any of the other files except this.</p>
                            <p>Now we need a way of telling the OpenGl and the Android projects to use the
                                <em>Content.mgcb</em> file under our Content project instead of their own. To do this,
                                first locate the <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file in the <strong>Content</strong>
                                directory for the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> window. Then right-click it and select <strong>Delete</strong>. Then
                                do the same in the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project.</p>
                            <p>Next, right-click the <strong>Content</strong> directory under the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel
                                and select <strong>Add &gt; Existing Item...</strong>. Navigate to the
                                <strong>shared-project-example</strong> directory we created. Then open the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Content</strong> directory, and then open the
                                <strong>Content</strong> directory inside of it. Single click (not double) the
                                <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file located in this directory. Next, notice that the
                                <strong>Add</strong> button in the bottom right of the <em>Add Existing Item</em> window
                                has a little arrow on it&#39;s right side. Click this, and select the <strong>Add As
                                    Link</strong> option.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">

                            <div class="card text-white bg-dark mb-3">
                                <div class="card-header">

                                </div>
                                <div class="card-body">
                                    <p>
                                        When you open the MyAwesomeGame.Content/Content directory and go to select the
                                        <b>Content.mgbc</b> file above, you may actually instead see an empty directory
                                        with no files. If this happens, click the dropdown located at the bottom right
                                        of the window and change it from <i>Visual C#</i> to <b>All Files</b>. Then you
                                        should see it.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>By clicking the <em>Add As Link</em> option, we&#39;re not actually adding the
                                <em>Content.mgcb</em> file to our Android project. Instead, anytime the Android project
                                references the Content.mgcb file, for instance when it compiles, it will instead now use
                                the Content.mgcb file located in our Content project.  So now, do the same steps we just did
                                to add the <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file to the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project, but remember to use the <strong>Add As
                                    Link</strong> option.</p>
                            <p>There is one last thing we need to do. When we added the <strong>Content.mgcb</strong>
                                files back to the projects as <em>Existing Items</em>, they no longer contain the correct
                                <strong>Build Action</strong> property, so we need to set that. First, select the
                                <strong>Content.mgbc</strong> file under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong>
                                project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel. Then in the <em>Properties</em> panel,
                                for the <strong>Build Action</strong>, change it to
                                <strong>MonoGameContentReference</strong>.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"

                                        If you do no see the property panel in Visual Studio, you may have hidden or
                                        closed it by accident. If so, you can reopen it by clicking <b>View > Property
                                            Window</b>

                            </div>

                            <p>Once you have changed the <em>Build Action</em>, do the same steps for the
                                <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file in the OpenGL project.</p>
                            <p>Now lets test that they are all using the same Content project. First, located the
                                <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Content</strong>
                                project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel and open it to launch the <em>MonoGame
                                    Pipeline Tool</em> window. Add a new <em>SpriteFont Description</em> item and name
                                it <strong>font</strong>.spritefont.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\add-sprite-font.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once you&#39;ve finished adding it, save and close the window. Now, open the
                                <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file for either the Android project or the OpenGL project,
                                you should see that both of them have the <strong>font.spritefont</strong> item listed.
                                Now all projects are using the same single shared content file.</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=testing-our-projects-2>Testing Our Projects</h2>
                            <p>For the last part of this section of the tutorial, lets test our two projects to see

                            <p>Now, according the the code above, when we run our game on an android device, it should
                                display the <em>Hello World! This is the Android Project</em>, and when we run this on a
                                Desktop as the OpenGL project it should display <em>Hello World! This is the OpenGL
                                    project</em>. So lets test this.</p>
                            <p>First, make sure <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> is set as the StartUp Project. To
                                do this, right-click it in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select <strong>Set
                                    as StartUp Project</strong>. Then click the <strong>Start</strong> button at the top
                                of Visual Studio. The game will launch and you should see the following message
                                displayed</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\opengl-game-launch.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>If you have an android device, we can also test the Android project directly on the
                                device. If you do not have an android device, feel free to skip to the next section.
                            </p>
                            <p>To test on your android device, first you need to make sure you have <strong>Developer
                                    Options</strong> unlocked and <strong>USB Debugging</strong> enabled. To do this, on
                                your device go to <strong>Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Information</strong>.
                                Scroll down to where it lists the <strong>Build Number</strong> and tape the
                                <strong>Build Number</strong> seven times. Once finished, you&#39;ll receive a message
                                about the <strong>Developer Options</strong> now being available. Next go to
                                <strong>Settings &gt; Developer Options</strong> and scroll down to <strong>USB
                                    Debugging</strong> and toggle it on. This allows us to perform application debugging
                                using our Android device when it&#39;s connected to a computer via USB. </p>
                            <p>Next, make sure the device screen is on and unlocked if you have to enter a password or
                                pin to open it. Then connect the device to your computer via a USB cable. Once you do,
                                you&#39;ll receive a message popup on the device asking for permission for USB debugging
                                for your computer. Click to accept this.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in Visual Studio, locate the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in
                                the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window, right-click it and select <strong>Set as StartUp
                                    Project</strong>. Once you do, the <strong>Start</strong> button at the top of
                                Visual Studio will change to the name of your Android device. If you click the Start
                                button now, Visual Studio will build the android apk, push it to your android device and
                                automatically launch it. When it does, you should see the game with the Android message
                                this time.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">

                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=conclusion-2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>In this approach, we created a C# Shared Project. This shared project is then referenced
                                by our platform specific projects. When a platform specific project compiles, it
                                includes the code from the shared project. If any code in the shared project is blocked
                                out using the <code>#if</code> preprocessor directive, and it is not using the symbol
                                that the platform specific project uses, it is not complied as part of the project.</p>
                            <p>This approach works better than the Class Library approach for couple of reasons. For
                                one, we don&#39;t have to include a <strong>.dll</strong> with our game when we
                                distribute it for people to play. This helps keep the total number of files down. The
                                second reason is the build will theoretically be smaller. Since code in an
                                <code>#if</code> preprocessor directive is only included in the compile if the symbol
                                for that project included, we&#39;re only compiling what we need.</p>
                            <p>The next, and final approach that we&#39;ll look at uses the MonoGame Shared Project
                                template. This is going to be almost completely identical to this shared project with
                                the exception that we can manage our content as well within the shared project without
                                needing to add a separate project just for content.</p>
                            <h1 class="mt-5" id=method-3-the-monogame-shared-project-approach>Method 3: The MonoGame Shared Project
                                Approach</h1>
                            <p>If you&#39;ve been following through this tutorial completely so far, then this section
                                is going to be almost exactly the same as the previous section where we used the Shared
                                Project approach. That&#39;s because the <strong>MonoGame Shared Project</strong> itself
                                <em>is</em> a C# Shared Project. It is just configured slightly different to allow us to
                                manage our content within the shared project as well.</p>
                            <p>Just like with the previous Shared Project approach, this will allow us to to create a
                                solution with all of our game code in one central project. This project is then shared
                                with our platform specific projects to use. The platform specific projects then act as a
                                launcher that launches the game using the shared code. </p>
                            <p>So lets get started.</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=create-the-solution-3>Create The Solution</h2>
                            <p>Just like with the previous approach, we are going to start with by creating a blank
                                solution. First, we need to create a new directory on our computer to store the new
                                solution file. For the purposes of this tutorial, create a new folder on your desktop
                                called <strong>monogame-shared-project-example</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Next, launch Visual Studio if you don&#39;t already have it open. On the top menu click
                                <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project</strong>. This will open the <em>New Project</em>
                                window. At the top right of this window is a search box. Click this and enter
                                <strong>Blank Solution</strong> for your search. Select the <strong>Blank
                                    Solution</strong> item (it should be the only one listed.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"

                            </p>
                            <p>At the bottom of the <em>New Project</em> window, we need to give our solution a name.
                                Let&#39;s call it <strong>MyAwesomeGame</strong>. After entering the name, click the
                                <em>Browse</em> button and navigate to and select the
                                <strong>monogame-shared-project-example</strong> directory that we created previously.
                                Also, for the purpose of what we&#39;re doing, be sure the <strong>Create directory for
                                    solution</strong> is unchecked. When finished, click the <em>Ok</em> button.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">

                            <p>Once you click the Ok button, Visual Studio will create the new solution file and open it
                                up. If you look in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel in Visual Studio, you should see
                                <em>Solution: &#39;MyAwesomeGame&#39; (0 Projects)</em> listed.</p>

                            <p>Now that we have our solution created, lets go ahead and create the <strong>MonoGame
                                    Shared Project</strong> that will be used as the central code base. To do this,
                                first right-click the solution in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select
                                <strong>Add &gt; New Project...</strong>. This opens the <em>New Project</em> window for
                                us again.</p>
                            <p>In the <em>New Project</em> window, click <strong>MonoGame</strong> on the left side of
                                the window under the <em>Visual C#</em> section to display all of the MonoGame project
                                types. Next, locate the <strong>MonoGame Shared Project</strong> item and select it.</p>
                            <p>

                            <p>Next, at the bottom of the window, we need to give our shared project a name. Let&#39;s
                                call it <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>. Remember, we append the name
                                <em>.Shared</em> to we can visually identify this as the shared project, and also so the
                                namespaces are generated correctly for us by Visual Studio when we create new code
                                files. You may also need to click the <em>Browse</em> button and navigate to and select
                                the <strong>monogame-shared-project-example</strong> directory that we created, if this
                                is not already the directory selected. When you&#39;re finished, click the <em>Ok</em>
                                button to create the project.</p>

                            <p>Overall, everything here is almost identical to what you normally have in the starting
                                Game1 file, with one exception. Scroll down to line 61, which is inside the
                                <code>Update</code> method. Here, there is already an <code>#if</code> preprocessor
                                directive being used similar to what we did in the previous section. This one only
                                compiles the section of code between #if and #endif if the platform project is not IOS
                                and is also not a TVOS platform. If you don&#39;t remember what the <code>#if</code>
                                preprocessor directive is for, don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll cover it again in a few
                                moments.</p>
                            <p>For now, close Game1.cs and lets move on to adding in our platform specific projects.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=add-a-monogame-cross-platform-desktop-project-3>Add A MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop
                                Project</h2>
                            <p>The first platform specific project type we&#39;re going to add is the <strong>MonoGame
                                    Cross Platform Desktop Project</strong>. To Add this project, right-click the
                                solution in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel and select <strong>Add &gt; New
                                    Project...</strong>, opening the <em>New Project</em> window. Select
                                <strong>MonoGame</strong> on the left under <em>Visual C#</em>, then select the
                                <strong>MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop Project</strong> item.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\select-monogame-cross-platform.png"

                            </p>
                            <p>Now we need to give this project a name at the bottom. Let&#39;s call it
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong>. We&#39;ll use <em>.OpenGL</em> appended to the
                                name because while this project supports Windows, Mac, and Linux, the one thing they all
                                have in common within this project is that OpenGL is used for the graphics library. Be
                                sure to click the <em>Browse</em> button and navigate to and select the
                                <strong>monogame-shared-project-example</strong> directory we created. When finished,
                                click the <em>Ok</em> button.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"

                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once you click the Ok button, Visual Studio will generate the project for you based on
                                the MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop Project template. You can see the project and all of
                                the generated files in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel. Find the
                                <strong>Program.cs</strong> file that was generated and open it. </p>
                            <p>The <strong>Program.cs</strong> file contains the <code>static void Main</code> method,
                                which is the starting point when your game is run. On line 16 and 17, you see the
                                following code</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">            <span class="token keyword">using</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">var</span> game <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token class-name">Game1</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
                game<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">Run</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
                            <p>The <code>using</code> statement creates a new instance of the <code>Game1</code> class,
                                then calls the <code>Run</code> method. This is how this specific platform project
                                launches your game. We need to adjust this so instead it is calling the
                                <code>Game1</code> class from the Shared project, this way it&#39;s using the one
                                central shared code base.</p>
                            <p>To do this, first located the <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window,
                                right-click it, then select delete to remove it.</p>
                            <p>Next, if you don&#39;t still have it open, locate <strong>Program.cs</strong> under
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel
                                and open it. You should see immediately that it now has an error on line 16 when it
                                calls <code>new Game1()</code>. This is because we deleted the Game1 for this project,
                                so right now it has no idea what Game1 is, or for that matter, where to locate it. So we
                                need to show it where to locate it. To do this, we need to add a reference to the Shared
                                project. </p>
                            <p>Find <strong>References</strong> under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel, right-click it and select <strong>Add
                                    Reference...</strong>. This will open the <em>Reference Manager</em> window. Click
                                <strong>Shared Project</strong> in the list on the left, then check the box for
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong> in the middle. Finally, click the <em>Ok</em>
                                button when finished.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\add-shared-project-reference-opengl.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once you click the Ok button, you should now see <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>
                                listed under the references for the project.</p>
                            <p>Next, in the <strong>Program.cs</strong> file, on line 2, add the following</p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> MyAwesomeGame<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Shared<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
                            <p>Now, the call to <code>new Game1()</code> on line 16 will no longer have an error.
                                We&#39;ve add the reference to our Shared project and the using statement at the top, so
                                it now knows what and where the Game1 class is. Save and close the Program.cs file.</p>
                            <p>Now, lets make sure this is working the way we intend it to. Open the
                                <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under our Shared project. Find the constructor, which
                                should start on line 21. We&#39;re going to edit it to make the game launch in a window
                                instead of full screen. Change it to look like the following</p>
                            <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token function">Game1</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
                            <p>One final adjustment that needs to be made is to delete the <code>using
                                    Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage;</code> statement found at the top of the Game1.cs
                                file on line 6. We&#39;re deleting this because this namespace no longer exists.</p>
                            <div class="card text-white bg-dark mb-3">
                                <div class="card-header">

                                        The <b>Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Storage</b> namespace was removed from MonoGame,
                                        however the MonoGame Shared Project template still includes it in the Game1.cs
                                        file. If you'd like to read more on why it was removed from MonoGame, view this

                            <p>Now, if we click the <strong>Start</strong> button at the top, our game should launch in
                                a window with a nice cornflower blue background. We have successfully now added a new
                                platform project and connected it to our central shared project that contains our game
                                logic. </p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=add-a-monogame-android-project-3>Add A MonoGame Android Project</h2>
                            <p>We want our game to be truly multiplatform. And what is more multiplatform than also
                                supporting mobile devices like Android. So lets add a MonoGame Android Project. </p>
                            <p>First, right-click the solution in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select
                                <strong>Add &gt; New Project...</strong> to open the <em>New Project</em> window. Click
                                <strong>MonoGame</strong> on the left under <em>Visual C#</em>, then select the
                                <strong>MonoGame Android Project</strong> item.</p>
                            <p>

                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\select-monogame-android.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Then, just like before, we need to give the project a name at the bottom. Let&#39;s call
                                this one <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong>, since it&#39;s for Android. Be sure to
                                click the <em>Browse</em> button and choose the
                                <strong>monogame-shared-project-example</strong> directory that we created earlier. When
                                finished, click the <em>Ok</em> button</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\give-android-name.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Now, when creating a new MonoGame Android project, there are a couple of things we have
                                to configure. The first is that we need to add an AndroidManifest file. What this file
                                is is beyond the scope of this tutorial, however we still have to add it. To do this,
                                right-click the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> window and select <strong>Properties</strong> to open the
                                <em>Properties</em> window. Locate <strong>Android Manifest</strong> on the left, then
                                click the <strong>No AndroidManifest.xml found. Click to add one.</strong> link to
                                generate it. </p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\add-androd-manifest.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once it finishes, you will receive a <em>File Modification Detected</em> notification pop
                                up. This is normal, just click the <strong>Reload All</strong> button. Once this is
                                finished, click the save button at the top of Visual Studio, then close the properties
                                window.</p>
                            <p>Next, we need to open the <strong>Activity1.cs</strong> file located under
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window.
                                Immediately, you should see that there is an error on line 13. This is is because the
                                code added when the project is generated is out of date, so lets fix it really quick.
                                Change line 13 to the following (note that you need to include the , at the beginning)
                            </p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token punctuation">,</span> LaunchMode <span class="token operator">=</span> LaunchMode<span class="token punctuation">.</span>SingleInstance</code></pre>
                            <p>That takes care of the quick things we need to do, now let&#39;s hook up our Android
                                project so that it&#39;s using the Shared project just like our OpenGl project. First,
                                locate <strong>Game1.cs</strong> under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and open it. While this is largely identical to the
                                Game1 class file that was generated by our OpenGl project, there is a small difference.
                                Notice that starting on line 20 in the constructor, there are various properties being
                                set for the graphics object.</p>
                            <p>These are important things to set for our android project so we need to ensure we are
                                still setting them in our shared project. So close the Game1.cs file, and then locate
                                the <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>
                                project. In here you&#39;ll notice that on line 19 in the constructor we already are
                                setting the IsFullScreen property, but we are setting it to <code>false</code>. For
                                Android, we need to set it to <code>true</code>. So how do we resolve this.</p>
                            <p>Well, this is where the <code>#if</code> preprocessor directive comes into play. If
                                you&#39;re not familiar with what that is, you can read up on it at <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if</a>.
                                Basically, it allows us to use a <em>Symbol</em> to define blocks of code that will
                                only be compiled if the symbol exists. These Symbols are passed to the compiler by our
                                individual platform projects when they are built. If you right-click on the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window,
                                select <strong>Properties</strong>, then click <strong>Build</strong> on the left of the
                                <em>Property Window</em>, you can see that this project is has a <strong>Conditional
                                    compilation symbol</strong> value of <strong>ANDROID</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\android-symbol.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>If you do the same for the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> project, you&#39;ll see
                                that it has a <strong>Conditional compilation symbol</strong> value of
                                <strong>LINUX</strong>. Yep, its value is Linux, that&#39;s what the MonoGame team
                                decided to use. </p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\linux-symbol.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>In the Class Library approach previously, we had to setup an enum that would be passed to
                                the Game1 constructor, its value cached, and then referenced throughout our project.
                                Using the preprocessor directives, we don&#39;t need to do this anymore. So, in the
                                <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file for the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong> project,
                                change the constructor to the following</p>
                            <pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">        <span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token function">Game1</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<span class="token preprocessor property">#<span class="token directive keyword">endif</span></span>
        <span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
                            <p>When finished, be sure to save the file. Making use of the <code>#if</code> statement
                                will become vital when developing your game as multiplatform. There will be times, like
                                above, where you need to set some values or do things differently for one platform
                                versus another.</p>
                            <p>Now that we have our shared Game1 class file setup for both projects, located the
                                <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> and delete
                                it, just like we did before. Next, if it is not already open, open the
                                <strong>Activity1.cs</strong> file under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong>
                                project. You&#39;ll notice that just like with the OpenGL project, we now have an error,
                                on line 21, because it doesn&#39;t know what or where Game1 is. So lets fix this.</p>
                            <p>Locate <strong>References</strong> under <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> in the
                                <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel, right-click it select <strong>Add
                                    Reference...</strong> to open the <em>Reference Manager</em> window. Then just like
                                before, click <strong>Shared Projects</strong> on the left and check the box for
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong>. Finally click Ok to close the <em>Reference
                                    Manager</em> window and add the reference.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\add-shared-project-reference-opengl.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Next, in the Activity1.cs file, at the top, add the following using statement just as we
                                did before. </p>
                            <pre
                                class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp"><span class="token keyword">using</span> MyAwesomeGame<span class="token punctuation">.</span>Shared<span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
                            <p>And just like with our OpenGL project, after adding the using statement above, the error
                                on line 22 goes away. Since it has the reference it now know what and where Game1 is.
                            </p>
                            <p>And that&#39;s it, we&#39;ve now successfully add a new platform specific project
                                (Android), and connected it to use the same shared code logic that is used by our other
                                project. And we can separate logic using the preprocessor directives if needed.</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=using-the-shared-project-for-content>Using The Shared Project For Content</h2>
                            <p>One of the great things about using the <strong>MonoGame Shared Project</strong> is that
                                we can also use it as the central location for all of the content we need to add for our
                                game. In the Class Library and the Shared Project approaches we discussed previously,
                                both of these rely on setting up a separate project to manage the content. No need for
                                that here.</p>
                            <p>Remember the <strong>Content</strong> directory in our Shared project I said we&#39;d
                                come back to. If you look at it in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel, you&#39;ll see
                                that there&#39;s no files in it. However, there actually is. Like other projects, it
                                contains a <em>Content.mgcb</em> file, it&#39;s just not included in the project.
                                If you click the <strong>Show All Files</strong> button at the top of the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> panel, you can see it.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\show-all-files.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Now that you can see it, right-click the <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file and select
                                <strong>Include In project</strong>. Once you do this, the icon for the file will change
                                to the MonoGame icon, and it is now included as part of the Shared project. Click the
                                <strong>Show All Files</strong> button at the top of the <em>Solution Explorer</em>
                                panel again so we&#39;re not seeing additional files we don&#39;t need to see.</p>
                            <p>Next, locate the <strong>Content</strong> directory under the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window,
                                right-click it and select delete. Do the same thing for the
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong>. We no longer need these since we are going to be
                                managing content in our shared project.</p>
                            <p>Now lets add some content to our project. Located the <strong>Content.mgcb</strong> file
                                under the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Shared</strong> project in the <em>Solution
                                    Explorer</em> panel and open it to launch the <em>MonoGame Pipeline Tool</em>
                                window. Add a new <em>SpriteFont Description</em> item and name it
                                <strong>font</strong>.spritefont.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\add-sprite-font.png"

                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>Once you&#39;ve finished adding it, save and close the window. That&#39;s it. So much
                                simpler than what we had to set up in the previous Class Library and Shared Project
                                approaches.</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=testing-our-projects-3>Testing Our Projects</h2>
                            <p>For the last part of this section of the tutorial, lets test our two projects to see
                                another example of how we can write our code in one place and manage the differences
                                needed for the platforms using the <code>#if</code> directive.</p>
                            <p>First, open the locate and open the <strong>Game1.cs</strong> file under
                                <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Share</strong> in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> panel. Make a new
                                line after line 18 where the SpriteBatch object field is and create a new SpriteFont
                                field named <strong>font</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Now, according the the code above, when we run our game on an android device, it should
                                display the <em>Hello World! This is the Android Project</em>, and when we run this on a
                                Desktop as the OpenGL project it should display <em>Hello World! This is the OpenGL
                                    project</em>. So lets test this.</p>
                            <p>First, make sure <strong>MyAwesomeGame.OpenGL</strong> is set as the StartUp Project. To
                                do this, right-click it in the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window and select <strong>Set
                                    as StartUp Project</strong>. Then click the <strong>Start</strong> button at the top
                                of Visual Studio. The game will launch and you should see the following message
                                displayed</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\opengl-game-launch.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>If you have an android device, we can also test the Android project directly on the
                                device. If you do not have an android device, feel free to skip to the next section.
                            </p>
                            <p>To test on your android device, first you need to make sure you have <strong>Developer
                                    Options</strong> unlocked and <strong>USB Debugging</strong> enabled. To do this, on
                                your device go to <strong>Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Information</strong>.
                                Scroll down to where it lists the <strong>Build Number</strong> and tape the
                                <strong>Build Number</strong> seven times. Once finished, you&#39;ll receive a message
                                about the <strong>Developer Options</strong> now being available. Next go to
                                <strong>Settings &gt; Developer Options</strong> and scroll down to <strong>USB
                                    Debugging</strong> and toggle it on. This allows us to perform application debugging
                                using our Android device when it&#39;s connected to a computer via USB.</p>
                            <p>Next, make sure the device screen is on and unlocked if you have to enter a password or
                                pin to open it. Then connect the device to your computer via a USB cable. Once you do,
                                you&#39;ll receive a message popup on the device asking for permission for USB debugging
                                for your computer. Click to accept this.</p>
                            <p>Finally, in Visual Studio, locate the <strong>MyAwesomeGame.Android</strong> project in
                                the <em>Solution Explorer</em> window, right-click it and select <strong>Set as StartUp
                                    Project</strong>. Once you do, the <strong>Start</strong> button at the top of
                                Visual Studio will change to the name of your Android device. If you click the Start
                                button now, Visual Studio will build the android apk, push it to your android device and
                                automatically launch it. When it does, you should see the game with the Android message
                                this time.</p>
                            <p>
                                <div class="text-center">
                                    <img class="img-fluid border border-dark"
                                        src="\img\tutorials\multiplatform-game-development-with-monogame\start-android.png"
                                        alt="null" />
                                </div>
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="mt-5" id=conclusion-3>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>In this final approach, we created a MonoGame Shared Project. This shared project is then
                                referenced by our platform specific projects. When a platform specific project compiles,
                                it includes the code from the shared project. If any code in the shared project is
                                blocked out using the <code>#if</code> preprocessor directive, and it is not using the
                                symbol that the platform specific project uses, it is not complied as part of the
                                project.</p>
                            <p>I feel this approach out of the three discussed in this tutorial is probably the best one
                                to use. We don&#39;t have to compile and include .dll class libraries. We also can
                                selectively compile sections of code using the <code>#if</code> preprocessor directive
                                keeping out build sizes efficient. And the best part, we can manage the content directly
                                from the Shared project instead of another separate project.</p>
                            <p>Ultimately, which one you decide to use, if any, is up to you and the needs of your
                                project. I hope this tutorial has provided the information you came here to seek Be sure
